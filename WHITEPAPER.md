# Didier Queloz AI ($QUELOZ): Sui Move Protocol Whitepaper

**Abstract**  
This document specifies the technical architecture, object-centric Move tokenomics, and post-quantum cryptographic invariant proofs for **Didier Queloz AI** (`$QUELOZ`) deployed on the **Sui** network. Inspired by Didier Queloz's breakthroughs in *Astrophysics & Exoplanetology*, this protocol leverages Sui's object capability model to achieve high-assurance, parallel transaction execution.

### 1. Sui Object Capability Tokenomics

The native coin `$QUELOZ` is governed by a non-transferable `TreasuryCap<LAUNCHPAD_TOKEN>` with shared micro-escrow vaults:

```latex
\mathcal{C}_{sui} = \langle UID, \text{TreasuryCap}, \text{Balance}\langle SUI\rangle \rangle
```

Milestone disbursement executes atomic transfers without global lock contention via Sui's causal consensus DAG.

### 2. Post-Quantum Lattice Security Specification

State transitions are shielded by post-quantum algorithms certified by NIST:
1. **FIPS 203**: ML-KEM-768 lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism.
2. **FIPS 204**: ML-DSA-65 module-lattice digital signature algorithm.
